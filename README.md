# Sir Yes Sir
Have you ever wondered why you're always so sad? Well, sometimes I ask myself that question too! What I think I've found out is that naughty code that refuses to compile are my main sources of unstoppable sadness. Now that I've said all of this, you're most likely wondering: "How do I solve this problem then?". Well, the truth is you can't and you don't since naughty code is really just an inevitable part of life and you just gotta get used to it. So next time you bang your head on your keyboard or imagine all the methods you could use to destroy your laptop, remember that someone else probably *also* banged their head on *their computer* during the process of creating *your* laptop that you nearly destroyed. 


If you just read the paragraph above, I know exactly what your thinking: "What an inspirational guy huh?". Jk, haha, what a funny joke, I know that your're probably thinking the exact opposite; trust me, that's perfectly normal. But before you direct any curses towards the screen, think about the poor guy that had spent more than 30 minutes of precious homework time, taking time to write something ~~vaguely inspirational~~ ~~stupid~~ utterly useless, just so that he could convince himself that he was not procrastinating.
